    """ 
    The method 'pool.apply()' will lock the function call until the function call is finished. 
    The method 'pool.apply_sync()' will not lock the function call,the call results will return immediately instead 
    of waiting for the result, and each method call will be alloacted to a different process. 
    So in this case,pool.apply_async() is processing the search in parallel,
    while the pool.apply() is not. 
    The reason we can use pool.apply() to do search for range_partition and hash_partition data 
    is that as long as we know which partition to do searchï¼Œwe don't need to search in parallel.
